Release-specific documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Installation Guides and Configuration Reference are released at release
time, with draft material published to
docs.openstack.org/draft/draft-index.html. The rest of the guides are
continuously released.

To patch for the release-specific documentation, you should generally patch to
master branch with "backport: xxxx" (for example, backport: kilo) in the commit
message.

Installation Guides
-------------------

The OpenStack Installation Guide describes a manual install process for
multiple distributions based on the following packaging systems:

* Installation Guide for Debian 7.0 - will be published with Liberty
* `Installation Guide for openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server`_

* Operations Guide: Icehouse target, revised specifically to target that
  release

  with example requests and responses.

  to document API specifications, such as Identity.
